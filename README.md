# Test for word converter
I made a simple program that removes vowels from words(Twitter-> Twttr), which took me way longer than expected as i was always running into bugs. Then i made a test with it to get myself comfortable with assert and pytest. I will do a couple similar projects for the same reason. requirements to run this program are in the requirements.txt

PS. Both files should be in the same folder
